Monster Mash - Bobby Boris Pickett & the Crypt Kickers
I was (G)working in the lab late one night
When my (Em)eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my (C)monster from his slab began to rise
And (D)suddenly to my surprise
He did the (G)mash - He did the monster mash
The monster (Em)mash - It was a graveyard smash
He did the (C)mash - It caught on in a flash
He did the (D)mash - He did the monster mash
From my (G)laboratory in the castle east
To the (Em)master bedroom where the vampires feast
The (C)ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To (D)get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the(G)mash - They did the monster mash
The monster (Em)mash - It was a graveyard smash
They did the (C)mash - It caught on in a flash
They did the (D)mash - They did the monster mash
The (C)zombies were having fun The (D)party had just begun
The (C)guests included Wolf Man, (D) Dracula and his son
The (G)scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
(Em)Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
(C)...The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their (D)vocal group, "The Crypt-Kicker Five"
They played the (G)mash - They played the monster mash
The monster (Em)mash - It was a graveyard smash
They played the (C)mash - It caught on in a flash
They played the (D)mash - They played the monster mash
(G)Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
(Em)Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He (C)opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, (D-single strum)"Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?"
It's now the (G)mash - It's now the monster mash
The monster (Em)mash - And it's a graveyard smash
It's now the (C)mash - It's caught on in a flash
It's now the (D)mash - It's now the monster mash
Now (G)everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my (Em)monster mash is the hit of the land
For (C)you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you (D- single strum)get to my door, tell them Boris sent you
Then you can (G)mash - Then you can monster mash
The monster (Em)mash - And do my graveyard smash
Then you can (C)mash - You'll catch on in a flash
Then you can (D)mash - Then you can monster mash
